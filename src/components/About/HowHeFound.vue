      I discovered my passion for coding in college when I was tasked with
      building a simple web system for a class project. That project turned into
      something bigger: a full Student Information System — and I was hooked.

    <p class="text-secondary text-sm md:text-lg tracking-wider leading-loose">
      By my fourth year, I became the Lead Programmer in our cluster. I managed
      our team and led the development of a Human Resource Management System,
      which handled hiring processes, interviews, and applicant tracking. It
      took about three months — and countless cups of coffee — but it laid the
      foundation for my career.
