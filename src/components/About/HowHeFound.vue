      He began his journey in web development during his third year of college
      when one of his subjects, Project Management, required them to create a
      web-based system. The first system he developed was a Student Information
      System.

      During his fourth year of college, he was elected as the Lead Programmer
      of his cluster. His responsibilities included managing the programmers and
      overseeing the integration of their Enterprise Integration System (EIS).
      The system he developed was a Human Resource Management System, which
      handled tasks such as hiring, processing applicantsâ€™ requirements,
      conducting interviews, and more. It took him almost three months to
      develop this system.
